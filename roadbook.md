# P4 Info road book
## A basic Agile guide for university students

### Introduction

There is probably a lot you have heard about Agile, some good things, and most probably some very bad things as well. This road book is not meant to give you all the bells and whistles about Agile but to give you enough background and guidance to take the best out of this group project.

In a nutshell, Agile is about managing complexity when solving a problem and learning along the way. And by complexity, I mean any problem that can't be solved by simple solutions of copying something that already exists. Instead, you need to experiment and adapt your course of action in order to optimize your chances at solving the initial problem.

Agile is a way to tackle problems that have a high uncertainty and complexity, which means situations where a lot of the details about both the problem we are trying to solve and the possible solutions need to be discovered along the way.

If you know exactly what you need to do, and it has already been done before by others and you just need to copy it, then Agile won't necessarily be needed nor useful. But if you are working on a new concept, or you are building on an idea without a clear final goal in mind, then it will help you make it through.

The world we live in today is in constant change. We are uncovering new technologies and new fields of application for these technologies almost every day. Being in contact at least once to this paradigm during your studies is an important experience that will hopefully be useful in your future career.

This project introduces Agile through the development of an Android mobile app in groups of 4 students. You will be encouraged to publish your app on the Google PlayÂ® store if it reaches a sufficient level of quality.

In the next chapters, I will describe how the project is structured and how we recommend you to approach it.

### Your team

One thing that Agile values is individuals and their interactions over processes and tools. So despite some of the Agile principles being applicable to solo projects, it usually starts with a team. During this project, you are asked to form teams of 4 students whenever possible.

This size is small enough to optimize collaboration and at the same time big enough to experiment with the difficulties of interacting with several people while solving a problem as well as to build an app with satisfying quality by the end of the semester.

To each team, a "Coach" will be assigned. It can be a teaching assistant or a tutor, depending on the team.

It is quite important to understand the role of your coach. She is there to help you grow as a team! It means helping you resolve collaboration issues, helping you reflect on the way you work so you can improve. Your coach will also be there to defend your team during the final presentation and could help you score a few more points. It is therefore important to collaborate as much as you can with her and to consider her also as an ally and a member of your team.

Last but not least, the client is the very last part of your "extended" team. Indeed, the client is not directly in the day-to-day tasks of your project but she has an important role as well: to give you feedback.

It is also critical to consider your client as a part of your extended team. Agile prescribes the shortest feedback loops possible, so by including your customer in your extended team and building short feedback loops with her, you give yourselves the best chances to correct course as soon as possible and maximize your chances of building the right product for your customer. During the P4, your client is usually played by the teacher.

It is also encouraged to not work only with people you have already worked with. We strongly recommend to mix your teams a little. It's unlikely that you'll have the opportunity to work only with people you know and get along with in your future career, so experiencing that process of working with people you don't know that well is an important part of your student journey. Take the opportunity to try it out on this project.

### Choosing your app

Now that we have covered the team, let's focus on the next step: choosing the app you will be working on during the project. One particularity of the project is that you will be able to choose what app you work on. Which means that you will need to present 3 ideas from which we will select the one you will be implementing.

The reason why we do a selection is to avoid to have half of the teams doing the same app, for instance, an app to manage the fridge of your student apartment. We have nothing against such apps of course, but we would rather limit the number of similar apps to keep it fun for everyone. We also want to make sure that you will be able to deliver a working app within the semester, so if you pick an idea that is too ambitious or too challenging for this project, we would like you to have a couple of other ideas we can choose from as a backup.

There is no specific guidance when it comes to the type of app you can build. We ask you to be creative and to think outside the box. You can build a game, you can build an app that will be useful to you, or even build an app for a company. It's up to you and your team to come up with 3 app ideas and to defend them.

Should you choose to build an app for a company, then we recommend to get in touch with your teacher ASAP, because it may require some additional explanation and maybe some signed agreements with the company itself.

##### The product box/poster

We want to keep things simple, also because as you don't know yet exactly what your client will like or not about your app, you don't want to specify everything in advance, at least not so soon. The whole point of Agile approaches is to have a minimum amount of information to get started and to discover the rest along the way with customers and market feedback. So, at this point we just want you to imagine what your "[product box](https://www.innovationgames.com/product-box/)" would be.

This practice reminds me of the times you actually had to go to physical stores to buy your software, and they would come in those big cardboard boxes with a cd and leaflets in it (or floppy disks, you know, what the "save" icon looks like today...). Just take a look at this old [Windows 98 Macintosh edition box](https://www.deviantart.com/malekmasoud/art/Microsoft-Windows-98-Macintosh-Edition-box-773687655).

![Windows 98](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/f5ad18b7-74e3-42a4-a6c3-ed075ba5d058/dcsmt7r-1da6bda9-949d-43b6-8891-a977983d50fb.png/v1/fill/w_1280,h_595,q_80,strp/microsoft_windows_98___macintosh_edition__box__by_malekmasoud_dcsmt7r-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD01OTUiLCJwYXRoIjoiXC9mXC9mNWFkMThiNy03NGUzLTQyYTQtYTZjMy1lZDA3NWJhNWQwNThcL2Rjc210N3ItMWRhNmJkYTktOTQ5ZC00M2I2LTg4OTEtYTk3Nzk4M2Q1MGZiLnBuZyIsIndpZHRoIjoiPD0xMjgwIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.C-qSLBuc178v_HMiEH9TTaQJdFXeNCXUM6XwWtmjiqo)

It's got sentences like "Improve and expand your PC experience with Windows 98", a big red star reading "You can now use windows 98 on your MAC", and the large "Works better, Plays better". It also includes an image of what the Windows 98 desktop looks like.

Let's look at a more recent example, for instance, the [Witcher 3 PS4 box](http://vgboxart.com/boxes/PS4/73072-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-full.png).

![Witcher 3](http://vgboxart.com/boxes/PS4/73072-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-full.png)

They are trying to tease you with sentences like "Fullfill your prophecy", "A rich open world to explore", "Lots of side quests to complete". It also shows a few action screenshots so you can get a feeling of the details in the game as well as the atmosphere.

That's what we expect you to do for your 3 ideas, in a much lower fidelity of course. We don't expect you to create art, we just want you to think about the kind of sentence you would put on your box and to draw with a pencil the main screens your app would have.

Even if you don't have a product yet, try to sell it to us! It's like a movie teaser! In other circles, this kind of exercice is also known as [value proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_proposition) design, although in the scope of this project, we try to keep it as simple as possible.

In a product box workshop, the customer is usually the main contributor. In our case unfortunately, not all your ideas have "real" customers (at least not yet), so you have to put yourselves in their shoes for now and come up with a "product box" that clearly illustrate what you plan on working on  during the project.

In order to make things even simpler, we don't ask you to build an actual box like the examples above but rather to create an A2 (or A3) poster. On it, we would like to at least see the following items:

* A name for your app or game
* A tagline (Snapchat has "The fastest way to share a moment", Spotify has "Music for everyone")
* A paragraph describing your app, around 35 to 50 words is enough
* A drawing/prototype of the main screens you have in mind at the moment (hint: it will change during the project but that's alright)

There is a rough example of  poster [on Moodle](https://moodleucl.uclouvain.be/pluginfile.php/1426811/mod_folder/content/0/poster.png). You can be as creative as you'd like but bear in mind that this is only a support to present your idea, not work of art.

It is expected that you bring your three posters during the first presentation of ideas.

#### Wrapping up

Here are a few questions to keep in mind when brainstorming ideas of apps with your team:

* [ ] Is this app not too complex to be built during one semester?
* [ ] Is it original and fun to work on, does the whole team feel motivated by it?
* [ ] Do we have a way to test this app with the mobile devices we have available in the team? If not, what do we need?

You don't have to tick all those three boxes, but if you do, then you know your idea is a good candidate for this project.

### Your first iteration

You made it through the first step. You have received the app selection, it is now time to start working on it. So your first assumption is that you need to define the data model for all the screens and all the features you thought of and build a "skeleton" of all the screens you want to build that you will later fill in with actually valuable features. You will then proudly show this to the customer after the first iteration. Unfortunately, your customer won't be happy...

As a customer, I expect to see value being delivered as soon as possible in the development of my project. Especially if there are very critical aspects of the app that needs to be understood and tested first. For instance, let's say you are building a wifi tester app that allows you to analyze the wifi signal strength in your house, what is the most critical hypothesis? That you can create several screens to build the plan of your house or that you can technically test the wifi signal with a smartphone?

#### Identify your Leap Of Faith Assumption

In Lean Startup, a very interesting concept was introduced: The leap of faith assumption, or LOFA. The idea is rather simple, it is one or multiple assumptions, that, should they fail to be verified, put the entire concept of your product or the whole business in jeopardy. So it is strongly advised to, as soon as you possibly can, test those LOFAs to make sure you don't spend too much time and money on something no one will need or that you don't have the possibility to build. It is literally prioritization by riskiest assumption. LOFAs can be both business and market assumptions but also linked to the technical feasibility of your product.

What does it mean in the context of this project? Let's look at our wifi tester example. Let's say that one of your assumption is that you have the necessary skills and that it is technically feasible to build a piece of code that can test the wifi strength with a smartphone. How do we test that? There are many ways you could prove that, either with or without code. One way would be to build a single screen with a large "Test wifi" button that executes the logic behind the scenes to test the wifi signal and then shows a human readable result on the screen. Of course, it doesn't mean there is not a substantial amount of work behind it, but we are stripping down the initial concept to the bare minimum so that we can prove the most critical hypothesis we have.

Once we have that covered, then we can spend the rest of our time to build a map of the house, maybe a database to share past results, etc... These later features are those we are confident we can build because it has been done before by many and we can find extensive documentation on how to build it. But by focusing on our riskiest assumption first, we are getting it out of the way and already delivering something useful to our customer. This approach can be comparable to building a Minimum Viable Product or MVP.

This prioritization is critical to making progress during this project. It means that you should start by focusing on the hardest part of your app before starting on the rest and focusing only on that in the first iterations.

#### Focus on the present need

Don't work on things that "you might need later" unless really necessary. This mindset is often linked to the YAGNI mindset ([You Ain't Gonna Need It](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)) which takes it's roots in the Simple Design concept introduced in one of the Agile approaches, XP ([eXtreme Programming](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html)).

Does it mean there is no place for planning, requirements and architecture design at all? Of course not. You will still need to think about your architecture, your data model and other activities needed to build a fully functional app. The whole idea of YAGNI is to avoid over engineering your solution and to focus on what is really needed to solve your problem now, not the problems you'll have to solve in two or three iterations. YAGNI doesn't mean not documenting, but it forces you to reduce the scope to what you need now and not what you'll need later later. One iteration at a time.

This obviously requires a good level of maturity about software architecture that is difficult to teach during this project but if you end up in a technical role in a startup or another company later on, this philosophy will most probably make sense then.

A critical prerequisite to YAGNI is that the code is easy to change so you won't always have the luxury to apply it. Sometimes, changes need to be made to make the code and the architecture more flexible before.

It's all about balance and context. And a nice way to illustrate it is by using a "cursor" metaphor. Depending on your context and project, you'll need to plan as much as you can for what's ahead and perform a thorough analysis. In another context, you'll have the opportunity to go the opposite way and full "YAGNI" or find your balance somewhere in the middle.

The good thing about this project is that you start from a clean slate, meaning that there is not much code you can't change easily, allowing you to apply it.

You never know what the feedback of the customer will be during your demos, or what crazy ideas we will come up with during those meetings. You may also find technical limitations that force you to go a different path when you're stuck. So, not planning too far ahead allows you to make sure you don't work on things you will never need.

#### Your first client demo

The first iteration is over and you're ready to demo what you have so far. If you followed the previous advices, you should have a rather simple but functional app to show, even after two weeks. There is, however, most likely unfinished features, test data or other temporary things in your app.

As a customer, this is not really something you want to see. You don't expect the finished product but you want to make sure that whenever you tap on a button, it does something and that the label of the button is not "button".

A good rule of thumb is to hide anything that is unfinished. The goal is not to show unfinished work to show that you spent time on it. Your end customers will never care about the "time spent", they are interested about the "value delivered".

It is therefore very important to remove or hide anything that is not working, or that produces no outcome when triggered by the customer.

One last important point: Don't underestimate the time and effort it takes to merge all your respective changes together. Ideally, you'll want to make sure you have a "demo-able" version of your app the night BEFORE the demo. Don't do this a few minutes before, as it will likely result in an unhelpful review.

#### Your first retrospective



#### Wrapping up

### Your next iterations

Once you have got the idea of how to prioritize and have a first experience with this way of working, you should be ready to increment on your app and see your progress. From the second to the fourth iteration, we will just build up on what it existing at the end of each iteration. There are, however, a few things to keep in mind throughout this phase.

#### Don't neglect user experience

![How to build an MVP](https://www.spaceo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/minimum-viable-product-mvp.jpg)

It is tempting, when starting a new project, to consider that we just need to ship some functionality to make users happy, regardless of what it looks and feels like, and we will take care of the "design" later on. That is most of the time wrong, and not what is expected during this project.

Wikipedia defines [User Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) as:

> A person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service.

It means that the user experience is not just about the "colors" and how "beautiful" it looks, but also about how it "feels" using it. We have all once used a product where we couldn't find out what to do next, or a form that only shows errors on top and we have to scroll to see them, or even the difficulty to browse some websites on smartphone screens when there are popups, non-responsive layouts or other cookie banners blocking the screen space.

Notice than in the previous examples, I didn't talk about the "colors" or how perfect the font needs to be. I was talking about "usability". Anybody can ship a feature that just works, but it takes effort to ship a feature that is clear and straightforward to use.

So during your first iterations, it's ok to not to have a great design with an amazing color palette and a beautiful, but it is not ok to have features that your customer don't understand.

#### Build incrementally

#### Don't reinvent the wheel

#### Upgrade your git skills

#### Gather feedback

#### Wrapping up

### The last iteration

#### Publishing your app

#### The final demo
